# Runbook.site

Collection of open source Runbooks / Playbooks

## Contributing

It's basically a Hugo SSG website hosted on Cloudflare.

Add a new runbook by copying the [Runbook Template](https://github.com/raghuchinnannan/Runbook.site/blob/main/content/runbooks/runbook-template.md) and renaming it to something else, following the same format, and then raise the PR.

For updating existing runbooks, directly make changes to the specific markdown files and raise a PR.
